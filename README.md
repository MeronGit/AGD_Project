# AGD_Project
 Unreal Engine 4 Game demo project for Advanced Game Development (AGD) course.
 Using TwinStickShooter template as initial inspiration I created a snake game where the player can also shoot objects that get in their way.
 
 Elements used in this project:
 1. Multiplatform: Android, Windows - Game is playable on both platforms
 2. Plugins: ItemSpawnerPlugin
 3. Localization: English, Estonian, Japanese
 
 Additionally:
 User Interface elements for navigation between levels and instructions
 
 How to play:
 On Windows: Use WASD for movement and left mouse button or spacebar to shoot projectiles at cubes. On Android: use left virtual stick and button on right side to shoot.
 Gain points by collecting yellow balls
 You die if you crash into your tail (made out of white balls) or any other obstacle.
 
 Tips: 
 In this version it is possible to move between your tail elements if you move fast enough - can help you get through tricky situations. You can vary your speed. 
 The cube obstacles have health so you can get rid of them by shooting.
